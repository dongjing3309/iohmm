IO-HMM
=====
IO-HMM is a common model widely used in robotics. Here we provide a few simulation/recognition/parameter learning tools to better understand IO-HMM. Algorithms are implemented in Matlab, include Forward-Backward/Viterbi/EM for regular HMMs and IO-HMMs. 

This is an outcome of 2017 Intelligent-Systems qualifier recap.
